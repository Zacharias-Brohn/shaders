# FAQ for gamedevs
*How to legally integrate Fisheye shader into an upcoming game?*
* Add credit and indicate if changes were made, preferably in the end credits.
* Share the altered shader code on GitHub, if changed, under the same license.

### Credits
Besides the shaders created from the ground up by me, a few of them were created as entirely new versions of existing effects, like [Tilt Shift](/Shaders/TiltShift.fx), [Monitor Gamma](/Shaders/MonitorGamma.fx) or [ACES](/Shaders/ACES.fx).

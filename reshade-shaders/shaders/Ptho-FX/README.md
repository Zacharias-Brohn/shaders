# DownsampleSSAA

DownsampleSSAA emulates the look of downsampling the image from it's native resolution, to any custom lower resolution of your choice. It gives the impression of rendering at a lower resolution but with higher image quality comparable to supersampling. Includes settings to change the resolution, upscaling method, and amount of image blurring.

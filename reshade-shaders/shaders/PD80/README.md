Highly advanced Color Effects created for Reshade: https://reshade.me/
Always use with the latest version for compatibility and performance.

My primary focus is color, contrast, brightness manipulation. These shaders will allow you to make a near infinite amount of different coloring methods from gentle changes to very extensive alternate looks. All effects are able to create very finely graded coloring with high accuracy. Most effects can also be applied against the depth buffer so you can apply it differently to foreground and background, as well as against shadows, midtones, and highlights. The goal is to provide you with all options to make your game look how YOU want it to look.

The shaders are categorized (numbered) by suggested load order, but use as you see fit. Different load orders lead to different effects.

As always, I like to share. If you're happy with my work, all I would ask in return is: spread the word. You can link the download link above, or a link to this repository directly. 

For any questions, you can find me on the Reshade discord.

Enjoy, and make your games look nice(r)!
